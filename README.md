A plant disease classification system is a web application that can run on any local server. It can detect plant disease by comparing a sample plant leaf and a diseased plant leaf. It will contain all the necessary information about diseased plant leaves so that it can detect any diseased plant accurately. This system is built for the farmers so that they can easily find out whether their potato or bell pepper plant is diseased or not, easily by clicking a picture and uploading it to the system. And if the plant is diseased, they can take necessary steps to prevent it.
